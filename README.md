# ElectionGuard 2.0 Reference Implementation in Rust

> "ElectionGuard is a way of checking election results are accurate, and that votes have
> not been altered, suppressed or tampered with in any way. Individual voters can see that
> their vote has been accurately recorded, and their choice has been correctly added to
> the final tally. Anyone who wishes to monitor the election can check all votes have been
> correctly tallied to produce an accurate and fair result."

Although ElectionGuard is designed to be an industrial-strength solution to help secure
traditional civic elections, it can also be used for "low stakes" forms of polling as well.

Consider ElectionGuard anywhere the security and privacy properties provided by homomorphic
tallying could be beneficial.

# Project status: INCOMPLETE, <span style="color:red">**EXPERIMENTAL**</span>

## What is this project in particular and where does it fit in?

This project is an open source Rust implementation of ElectionGuard 2.0,
intended to serve as a reference or as production software for those wishing to incorporate
ElectionGuard into their systems.

The Rust Language was chosen for this reference implementation due to its:
- Innovative memory safety guarantees and excellent security and reliability track record
- Strong, static, well-defined, type system
- Runtime performance
- Cross platform compatibility and ability to integrate with external code defined in C
- Clean and consistent design

This is not the only implementation of ElectionGuard, some others are listed below.
